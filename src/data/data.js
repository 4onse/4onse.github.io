A notification system will provide alerts to stakeholders when a drought period is detected or when rainfall extreme event is registered. Drought hotspots. Due to its complexity there’s no universal method for detecting drought and calculating its severity but there are a number of generally accepted indicators that are used worldwide for this scope (Heim, 2002, Mishra and Sing, 2010). Most of these indexes rely on the availability of temperature and rainfall observations; some require other additional observed properties like soil moisture and vegetation stress. In the execution of this task the idea is to follow the approach proposed by Svoboda et al. (2002) to make these indexes available into an ensemble drought index. Intense rainfalls. The selection of rainfall events is also not universally defined: it is however commonly accepted to separate rainfall events on the basis of no-rain intervals longer then a defined threshold period. As reported by Gaàl et al. (2014), two main approaches to determine this threshold have been proposed in literature: 1) a conceptual approach which consider two rainfall events separated if they are conceptually independent (e.g.: soil wetness decrease enough not to impact the following run-off); 2) a statistical approach which determines the threshold value that leads to identify statistically insignificant rainfall autocorrelation. Based on analysis of Sri Lanka characteristics and data, the most suitable method to isolate extreme rainfall event will be selected. From an analysis of rainfall-events characteristics (total rainfall depth, event duration, average rainfall intensity and peak) and floods-events it will be possible to detect the depth of rain of a given duration, taken as uniform in space and time on a certain basin, necessary to cause minor flooding at the outlet of the considered basin.'
