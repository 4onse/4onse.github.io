Weather station documentation
------------------------------

This documentation aims to be a comprehensive guide to build the first official
version of the **4onse weather station**. It contains the full documentation both
for the hardware and the software components. Visit `<http://www.4onse.ch>`_
for more information and contact us to help, give your feedback or ask
specific questions.


What is 4onse?
--------------

The **4onse** project (4 TIMES OPEN & NON-CONVENTIONAL TECHNOLOGY FOR
SENSING THE ENVIRONMENT) is funded by the Swiss National Science
Foundation (SNSF) in the context of the Research for Development (R4D)
program with decision IZ07Z0_160906/1. One of the project outcames is an Environmental
Monitoring System (EMS) based on "Open" technogies, including software, hardware,
standard and data.

Overview
---------

The proposed weather station is a cost-effective solutions that
includes different sensors connected to the Arduino Mega 2560 board
that manages the data collection, logging and communication trough a
GPRS module (SIM800). Measures are automatically sent to the
istSOS_ open platform that enable data
management and distribution using the Sensor Observation Service (SOS_)
open standard from the Open Geoscpatial Consortium (OGC_).

The following climatic parameters are observed:

* External air temperature (**DS18B20**)
* External air humidity (**BME280**)
* Barometric Pressure (**BME280**)
* Precipitation (**Davis AeroCone collector**)
* Wind speed and direction (**SEN-08942**)
* Soil moisture (**YL-69**)

Currently, we are developing two versions based on the same components, but with different building strategies: the **4onse-mod** uses wires and connectors while **4onse-pcb** uses printed board.
